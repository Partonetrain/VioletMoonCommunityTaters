# VioletMoonCommunityTaters
 Resource pack for Violet Moon Community adding new Tiny Potatoes

**If you are using Botania, you have to rename the folders named "quark" to "botania" and replace every instance of "quark" with "botania" in the .json files**
You can fairly easily do this with notepad++

## Automatic build

Run build.sh with any posix-compatible shell
to generate two zip resource packs, for Quark and Botania.
